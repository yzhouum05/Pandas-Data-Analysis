# Sample-Code
This is an assignment I did for a data science course. I used Pandas and numpy libraries to aggregate and analyze the US GDP, 
housing price and demographic data from 2010 to 2016. It is found by t-test that the housing prices in college towns are 
less likely impacted by the economic recessions.
